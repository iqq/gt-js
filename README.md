# gt-js
gt.js, a Javascript library for augmenting interfaces to be responsive to gaze-based events.

### Building
This library requires `npm` to be built.  
In a terminal:  
1. Use git to clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/vialab/gt-js.git`
2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository
3. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`
4. run `npm run build` to compile the a minified version of the library
5. Alternatively `npm run dev` will run a build environment which compiles a non-minified version of the library continuously as changes are made to the source code (in the `src/` directory).

Either version of the library will be compiled to a single file in the `lib/` directory.
